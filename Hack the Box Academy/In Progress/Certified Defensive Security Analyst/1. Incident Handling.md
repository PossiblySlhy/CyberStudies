# Incident Handling

## Introduction
### Definitions and Scope
- `Event` > action occurring in a system or network
  - e.g. &rarr; user sending an email, a mouse click, a firewall allowing a connection request
- `Incident` > event with a negative conseqeunce
  - e.g. &rarr; data theft, funds theft, unauthorized access to data, installation and usage of malware and remote access tools
  - can occur due to natural disasters, power failures, etc.
  - no clear definition, varies by org
    - some orgs consider incidents events with clear intent to cause harm against their systems
  - may not be clear than an event is an incident
- `Incident handling` > clearly defined set of procedures to manage and respond to security incidents in a computer or network environment
  - not limited to intrusion incidents alone
  - malicious insiders, availability issues, and loss of intellectual property fall under scope
  - plans should address various types of incidents and provide appropriate mesaures to identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from them to restore normal bussiness operations quickly and efficiently

#### Important Resource
- [NIST's Computer Security Incident Handling Guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf)
  - aims to assist orgs in mitigating the risks from computer security incidents
  - provides practical guidelines on responding to incidents

### Cyber Kill Chain
- attack lifecycle (a.k.a Cyber Kill Chain)
- aescribes how attacks manifest
- nonlinear, attacker might move between various stages
  - e.g. &rarr; installation back to recon to identify additional targets and find other vulnerabilities
#### 7 Stages
1. `Reconaissance`
   - attacker chooses the target and performs information gathering
   - can be active or passive
     - use social media and job listings
     - some might poke around the network by scanning webapps and IP addresses
2. `Weaponize`
   - malware is developed and embedded into some type of exploit or deliverable payload
   - likely that the attacker has gather info to identify antivirus or `EDR` (Endpoinrt Detection and Response) technology
   - aiming to get remote access to a machine in the target environment and establish persistance
3. `Deliver`
   - malware payload is delivered
     - usually through phishing emails or dummy website that mimics an official site
     - some attackers may call the victim as part of a social engineering attack
     - extreme cases involve physical delivery via USB or other physical connections
   - credentials are collected
4. `Exploit`
   - the moment an exploit or payload is triggered
   - attack attempts to execute code to gain access or control
5. `Install`
   - stager is executed and is active
   - techniques include
     - `droppers` > small piece of code designed to install malware and execute it, delivered through email attachments, malicious websites, or social engineering tactics
     - `backdoors` > malware designed to provide the attacker with persistance on the system, may be installed during the exploitation stage or or via a dropper to execute further attacks or steal data
     - `rootkits` > malware designed to hide its presence on the system, used in the installation stage to evade detection by antivirus and other security tools
6. `Command and Control (C&C)`
   -  attacker establishes remote access capability to the compromised machine
   -  some may use modular stagers to load additional scripts on-the-fly
   -  more advanced threats may use separate tools to ensure multiple variants of the malware live in the network
7. `Action`
   - the objective of the attack
   - varies based on the threat actor
     - e.g. &rarr; exfiltration of data, privilege escalation to deploy ransomware

## Incident Handling Process
### Overview
- incident handling process defines an org's ability to prepare, detect, and respond to malicious events
- also contains stages, similar to the kill chain, but not 1-to-1
- cyclic, not linear
#### Stages (defined by NIST)
1. `Preparation`
2. `Detection and Analysis`
3. `Containment, Eradication, and Recovery`
4. `Post-Incident Activity`
<br/>
- most of the time is spent in `preparation` and `detection analysis`
  - resources should always be active on these two

#### Main activities
- `Investigation`
  - discover initial (patient zero) victim and create incident timeline
  - determine tools and malware attacker used
  - document compromised systems and what the attacker has done
- `Recovery`
  - involves creating and implementing a recovery plan
  - once plan is implemented, business should be back to normal operations
  - report is issued and "lessons learned" activities are performed

### Preparation Stage (In-depth)
- Objectives:
  1. Establishment of incident handing capability within the org
  2. Ability to protect against and prevent IT security incidents by implementing appropriate protective measures, including:
     - endpoint and server hardening
     - AD tiering 
     - MFA 
     - privileged access management

#### Preparation Prequisites
1. Skilled incident handling team members
2. Trained workforce
3. Clear policies and documentation
4. Tools (software and hardware)

#### Clear Policies and Documentation
Should include an up-to-date version of the following:
- Contact information and roles of the incident handling team members
- Contact information for the legal and compliance department, management team, IT support, communications and media relations department, law encforcement, ISPs, facility management, and external incident response team
- Incident response policy, plan, and procedures
- Incident information sharing policy and procedures
- Baselines of systems and networks, out ofa golden image and a clean state environment
- Network diagrams
- Organization-wide asset management database
- User accounts with excessive privileges that can be used on-demand by the team when necessary. These user accounts are normally enabled when an incident is confirmed during the initial investigation and then disabled once it is over. A mandatory password reset is also performed when disabling the users
- Ability to acquire hardware, software, or an external resource without a complete procurement process. The last thing you need during an incident is to wait for weeks for the approval of a $500 tool.
- Forensic/Investigative cheat sheets

#### Tools (Software and Hardware)
We need to ensure we have the right tools for the job, including but not limited to:
- Additional laptop or a forensic workstation for each incident handling team member to preserve disk images and log files, perform data analysis, and investigate without any resitrictions. These devices should be handled approriately and not in a way that introduces risks to the organization
- Digital fornesic image acquisition and analysis tools
- Memory capture and analysis tools
- Live response capture and analysis
- Log analysis tools
- Network capture and analysis tools
- Network cables and switches
- Write blockers
- Hard drives for forensic imaging
- Power cables
- Screwdrivers, tweezers, and other relevant tools to repair or disassemble, hardware devices if needed
- `Indicator of Compromise` (`IOC`) creator and the ability to search for IOCs across the organization
- Chain of custody forms
- Encryption software
- Ticket tracking system
- Secure facility for storage and investigation
- Incident handling system independent of your org's infrastructure
