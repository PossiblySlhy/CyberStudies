# Incident Handling

## Introduction
### Definitions and Scope

- `Event` > action occurring in a system or network
  - e.g. &rarr; user sending an email, a mouse click, a firewall allowing a connection request
- `Incident` > event with a negative conseqeunce
  - e.g. &rarr; data theft, funds theft, unauthorized access to data, installation and usage of malware and remote access tools
  - can occur due to natural disasters, power failures, etc.
  - no clear definition, varies by org
    - some orgs consider incidents events with clear intent to cause harm against their systems
  - may not be clear than an event is an incident
- `Incident handling` > clearly defined set of procedures to manage and respond to security incidents in a computer or network environment
  - not limited to intrusion incidents alone
  - malicious insiders, availability issues, and loss of intellectual property fall under scope
  - plans should address various types of incidents and provide appropriate mesaures to identify, contain, eradicate, and recover from them to restore normal bussiness operations quickly and efficiently


#### Important Resource

- [NIST's Computer Security Incident Handling Guide](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r2.pdf)
  - aims to assist orgs in mitigating the risks from computer security incidents
  - provides practical guidelines on responding to incidents

### Cyber Kill Chain

- attack lifecycle (a.k.a Cyber Kill Chain)
- aescribes how attacks manifest
- nonlinear, attacker might move between various stages
  - e.g. &rarr; installation back to recon to identify additional targets and find other vulnerabilities


#### 7 Stages

1. `Reconaissance`
   - attacker chooses the target and performs information gathering
   - can be active or passive
     - use social media and job listings
     - some might poke around the network by scanning webapps and IP addresses
2. `Weaponize`
   - malware is developed and embedded into some type of exploit or deliverable payload
   - likely that the attacker has gather info to identify antivirus or `EDR` (Endpoinrt Detection and Response) technology
   - aiming to get remote access to a machine in the target environment and establish persistance
3. `Deliver`
   - malware payload is delivered
     - usually through phishing emails or dummy website that mimics an official site
     - some attackers may call the victim as part of a social engineering attack
     - extreme cases involve physical delivery via USB or other physical connections
   - credentials are collected
4. `Exploit`
   - the moment an exploit or payload is triggered
   - attack attempts to execute code to gain access or control
5. `Install`
   - stager is executed and is active
   - techniques include
     - `droppers` > small piece of code designed to install malware and execute it, delivered through email attachments, malicious websites, or social engineering tactics
     - `backdoors` > malware designed to provide the attacker with persistance on the system, may be installed during the exploitation stage or or via a dropper to execute further attacks or steal data
     - `rootkits` > malware designed to hide its presence on the system, used in the installation stage to evade detection by antivirus and other security tools
6. `Command and Control (C&C)`
   -  attacker establishes remote access capability to the compromised machine
   -  some may use modular stagers to load additional scripts on-the-fly
   -  more advanced threats may use separate tools to ensure multiple variants of the malware live in the network
7. `Action`
   - the objective of the attack
   - varies based on the threat actor
     - e.g. &rarr; exfiltration of data, privilege escalation to deploy ransomware

## Incident Handling Process
### Overview

- incident handling process defines an org's ability to prepare, detect, and respond to malicious events
- also contains stages, similar to the kill chain, but not 1-to-1
- cyclic, not linear


#### Stages (defined by NIST)

1. `Preparation`
2. `Detection and Analysis`
3. `Containment, Eradication, and Recovery`
4. `Post-Incident Activity`
<br/>
- most of the time is spent in `preparation` and `detection analysis`
  - resources should always be active on these two


#### Main activities

- `Investigation`
  - discover initial (patient zero) victim and create incident timeline
  - determine tools and malware attacker used
  - document compromised systems and what the attacker has done
- `Recovery`
  - involves creating and implementing a recovery plan
  - once plan is implemented, business should be back to normal operations
  - report is issued and "lessons learned" activities are performed


### Preparation Stage (In-depth)

- Objectives:
  1. Establishment of incident handing capability within the org
  2. Ability to protect against and prevent IT security incidents by implementing appropriate protective measures, including:
     - endpoint and server hardening
     - AD tiering 
     - MFA 
     - privileged access management


#### Preparation Prequisites

1. Skilled incident handling team members
2. Trained workforce
3. Clear policies and documentation
4. Tools (software and hardware)


##### Clear Policies and Documentation

Should include an up-to-date version of the following:
- Contact information and roles of the incident handling team members
- Contact information for the legal and compliance department, management team, IT support, communications and media relations department, law encforcement, ISPs, facility management, and external incident response team
- Incident response policy, plan, and procedures
- Incident information sharing policy and procedures
- Baselines of systems and networks, out ofa golden image and a clean state environment
- Network diagrams
- Organization-wide asset management database
- User accounts with excessive privileges that can be used on-demand by the team when necessary. These user accounts are normally enabled when an incident is confirmed during the initial investigation and then disabled once it is over. A mandatory password reset is also performed when disabling the users
- Ability to acquire hardware, software, or an external resource without a complete procurement process. The last thing you need during an incident is to wait for weeks for the approval of a $500 tool.
- Forensic/Investigative cheat sheets


##### Tools (Software and Hardware)

We need to ensure we have the right tools for the job, including but not limited to:
  - Additional laptop or a forensic workstation for each incident handling team member to preserve disk images and log files, perform data analysis, and investigate without any resitrictions. These devices should be handled approriately and not in a way that introduces risks to the organization
  - Digital fornesic image acquisition and analysis tools
  - Memory capture and analysis tools
  - Live response capture and analysis
  - Log analysis tools
  - Network capture and analysis tools
  - Network cables and switches
  - Write blockers
  - Hard drives for forensic imaging
  - Power cables
  - Screwdrivers, tweezers, and other relevant tools to repair or disassemble, hardware devices if needed
  - `Indicator of Compromise` (`IOC`) creator and the ability to search for IOCs across the organization
  - Chain of custody forms
  - Encryption software
  - Ticket tracking system
  - Secure facility for storage and investigation
  - Incident handling system independent of your org's infrastructure
> *Many tools will be included in a go/jump bag*


#### DMARC

- `DMARC` (*Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance*) is email protection against phishing on top of already existing `SPF` (*Sender Policy Framework*) and `DKIM` (*DomainKeys Identified Mail*)
  - DMARC rejects emails that pretend to originate from within your org
  - rejects spoofed email before they reach the intended recipient
  - requires thorough testing, otherwise there might be rampant false positives with no way to recover the blocked emails


#### Endpoint Hardening & EDR

- endpoint devices (workstations, laptops, etc.) are the entry points for most attacks
- most popular endpoint hardening standards are CIS and Microsoft baselines
- Important actions (that work) to note and perform:
  - disable `LLMNR/NetBIOS`
  - implement `LAPS` and remove administrative privileges from regular users
  - disable or configure PowerShell in "ConstrainedLanguage" mode
  - enable `ASR` (*Attack Surface Reduction*) rules if used Microsoft Defender
  - implement whitelisting
    - nearly impossible to implement
    - consider blocking execution from user-writable folders (Downloads, Desktop, AppData, etc.)
    - block script types (.hta, .vbs, .vmd, .cmd, .bat, .js, etc.)
    - pay attention to `LOLBin` files when implementing whitelisting, they are used in the wild as initial access to bypass whitelisting
  - utilize host-based firewalls
    - at minimum, block workstation-to-workstation communication and block outbound traffic to LOLBins
  - deploy an EDR product
    - `AMSI` provides great visibility into obfuscated scripts for antimalware products to inspect the content before it's executed
    - recommended to only choose products that integrate with `AMSI`

> *Don't let perfect be the enemy of good* when it comes to hardening


#### Network Protection

- network segmentation helps keep breaches from spreading across the org
  - business critical systems should be isolated and connections should be allowed only as the business requires
  - internal resources should not be facing the internet directly (unless placed in a DMZ)
- consider `IDS/IPS` systems
  - shines when SSL/TLS interception is performed so that they can identify malicious traffic based on content on the wire and not based on reputation of IP addresses (inefficient)
- ensure only org-approved devices can get on the network
  - `802.1x` can be utilized to reduce the risk of BYOD or malicious devices connecting to the corporate network
  - if the org is cloud only, similar protection can be provided by Conditional Access policies that allow access to org resources only if you are connected from a managed device


#### Privilege Identity Management / MFA / Passwords

- stealing privileged user credentials is currently the most common escalation path in AD environments
  - common mistake, admin users have a weak (but often complex) password or a shared password with their regular user account
    - weak but complex e.g. Password1!
      - contains upper/lowercase, number, and special character but is still easily predictable and can be found in common password lists
    - teach employees to use passphrases to avoid this mistake
    - implement MFA tools for, at least, administrative access to **all** applications and devices


#### Vulnerability Scanning

- perform continuous vulnerability scans of your environment and remediate at least "high/ciritcal" vulnerabilties that are discovered
- scans can be automated, but fixes usually require manual remediation
- if patches can't be applied, at least segment these systems away from the rest of the network


#### User Awareness Training

- training users to recognize suspicious behavior and report it when discovered is a big win
- unlikely to reach 100% success rate, but still significantly reduce the number of successful compromises
  - periodic "surprise" testing should be part of the training, including monthly phishing emails, dropped USB sticks, etc.


#### Active Directory Security Assessment

- best way to detect security misconfigurations or exposed critical vulnerabilities is by looking for them as the attacker
  - do your own reviews or hire a third party
  - the more tools and activity an attacker is generating, the higher the likelihood of detection, try to eliminate easy wins and low-hanging fruit
- AD has a few known and unique escalation paths/bugs and new ones are discovered frequently
  - as such, security assessments are crucial for the security posture of the environment as a whole


#### Purple Team Exercises

- security assessments done by a red team that continuously or eventually inform the blue team about their actions, finding, visibility/security shortcomings
- train incident handlers and keep them engaged
- help identify vulnerabilities within the org while testing the blue team's capabilities in terms of logging, monitoring, detection, and responsiveness
  - if a threat goes unnoticed, there is oportunity to improve
  - for those that are detected, the blue team can test any playbooks and incident handling procedures to ensure they are robust and teh expected result has been achieved


### Detection and Analysis Stage

Involves all aspects of detecting an incident (i.e. utilizing sensors, logs, and trained personnel) and information and knowledge sharing, as well as utilizing context-based threat intelligence.

- threats are introduced to the org via an infinite amound of attack vectors and their detection can come from sources such as:
  1. An employee that notices abnormal behavior
  2. An alert from one of our tools (`EDR`, `IDS`, `Firewall`, `SIEM`, etc.)
  3. Threat hunting activities
  4. Third-party notification informing us they discovered signs of the org being compromised
- highly recommended to create levels of detection by logically categorizing the network as follows:
  1. Detection at the network perimeter (using firewalls, internet-facing network intrusion detection/prevention systems, DMZs, etc.)
  2. Detection at the internal network level (using local firewalls, host intrusion detection/prevention systems, etc.)
  3. Detection at the endpoint level (using antivirus systems, endpoint detection and response systems, etc.)
  4. Detection at the application level (using application logs, service logs, etc.)


#### Initial Investigation

Aim to collect as much information as possible about the following:
  - Date/time the incident was reported, who detected the incident and/or who reported it?
  - How was the incident detected?
  - What was the incident (i.e. phishing, system unavailability, etc.)?
  - Assemble a list of the impacted systems (if relevant)
  - Document who has accessed the impacted systems and what actions have been taken, make a note of whether this is an ongoing incident or the suspicious activity has stopped
  - Physical location, operating systems, IP addresses and hostnames, system owners, system's purpose, current state of the system
  - (*If malware is involved) List of IP addresses, time and date of detection, type of malware, systems impacted, export of malicious files with forensic information on them (i.e. hashes, copies of the files, etc.)
> *the compilation of this information helps in making decisions on appropriate actions to take, i.e. if we knew the CEO's laptop was compromised, different actions would be taken compared to an intern's laptop being compromised*
- with the initial information we gathered, we can build an `incident timeline`
  - the timeline will keep us organized throughout the event and provide an overall picture of what happened
  - events are time-sorted based on when they occurred
    - *events may not be discovered in this order*
  - time-sorting can provide additional context and shed some light on whether newly discovered evidence is part of the current incident
  
The incident timeline should contain the following, where the timeline focuses primarily on the attacker's behavior (ex:) <br/>
|  Date  |  Time of the event  |  hostname  |  Event description  |  Data source  |
| :----: | :-----------------: | :--------: | :-----------------: | :-----------: |
| 09/09/21 | 13:31 CET     | SQLServer 01| Hacking tool 'Mimikatz' was detected | Antivirus software | 


#### Incident Severity and Extent

When handling a security incident, we should try to answer the following questions to get an idea of the incident's severity and extent:
  1. What is the exploitation impact?
  2. What are the exploitation requirements?
  3. Can any business-critical systems be affected by the incident?
  4. Are there any suggested remediation steps?
  5. How many systems have been impacted?
  6. Is the exploit being used in the wild?
  7. Does the exploit have any worm-like capabilities?
  > *Last 2 can possibly indicate the level of sophistication of an adversary*


#### Incident Confidentiality and Communication

Incidents are very confidential topic and as such, all of the information gathered should be kept on a need-to-know basis, unless applicable laws or a management decision instruct as otherwise.
  - the adversary could be an employee
  - if a breach has occurred, communication to internal and external parties should be handled by the appointed person in accordance with the legal department


#### The Investigation

The investigation starts based on the initially gathered (and limited) information that contain what we know about the incident so far. With this initial data, we will begin a 3-step, cyclic process that we will repeat as the investigation evolves:
  1. Creation and usage of `indicators of compromise` (`IOC`)
  2. Identification of new leads and impacted systems
  3. Data collection and analysis from the new leads and impacted systems

##### Initial Investigation Data

In order to reach a conclusion: 
  - investigations should be based on valid leads that have been discovered not only during the initial phase, but throughout the entire process 
  - new leads should be brought up constantly 
  - the incident handling team shouldn't tunnel vision on a specific finding.
  > *Narrowing an investigation down to a specific activity often results in limited findings, premature conclusions, and an incomplete understanding of the overall impact*


##### Creation and Usage of IOCs

IOCs are a sign that an incident has occurred and are documented in a structured manner, which represents the artifacts of the compromise. Examples include:
  - IP addresses
  - hash values of files
  - file names

Because IOCs are so important to the investigation, special languages such as `OpenIOC` and `Yara` have been developed to document them and share them in a standard manner. Using these, we can describe and use the artifacts that we uncover during an incident investigation.

To leverage IOCs, we will have to deploy and IOC obtaining/searching tool (native or third party). A common approach is to utilize `WMI` or PowerShell for IOC related operations in Windows envrionments.

>**During an investigation, be extra careful to prevent highly privileged credentials from being cahced when connecting to (potentially) compromised systems**
  - this can be done by using protocols and tools that don't cache credentials such as `WinRM`
  - be aware of the tools you use and how/when they cache credentials, as some change behaviors depending on how they're used


##### Identification of New Leads and Impacted Systems

After searching for IOCs, expect to have some hits that reveal other systems with the same signs of compromise. These hits may not be directly associated with the incident currently being investigated, the IOC could be too generic, resulting in false positives.


##### Data Collection and Analysis from the New Leads and Impacted Systems

Once we identify systems that include our IOCs, collect and preserve the state of those systems for further analysis in order to uncover new leads and/or answer investigative questions about the incident. Depending on the system, there are multiple approaches to how and what data to collect:
  - Live response &rarr; collect a predefined set of data, usually rich in artifacts that may explain what happened in the system
  - Shut down, then analyze &rarr; not an easy decision since some artifacts live in RAM

Once data is collected, it's time to analyze it. Malware analysis and disk forensics are the most common examinations, memory forensics is becoming more popular and extremely relevant when dealing with advanced threats. Newly discovered and validated leads are added to the timeline.

> *Keep track of the chain of custody to ensure examined data is court-admissible if legal action is being considered*
