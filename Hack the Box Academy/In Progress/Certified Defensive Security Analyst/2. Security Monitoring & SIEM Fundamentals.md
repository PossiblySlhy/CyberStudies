### SIEM Definition & Fundamentals
#### What is SIEM?

`Security Information and Event Management` (SIEM) encompasses the utilization of software offerings and solutions that merge the management of security data with the supervision of security events. These instruments facilitate real-time evaluations of alerts related to security, which are produced by network hardware and applications.

#### SIEM Business Requirements and Use Cases

Log consolidation entails gathering terabytes of security information from vital firewalls, confidential databases, and essential applications. This empowers the SOC team to examine the data and discern connections, significantly improving threat visibility.
