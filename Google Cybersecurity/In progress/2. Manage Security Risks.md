## Week 1 - Security Domains

### CISSP Security Domains
- **Security Posture** &rarr; an organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change
- Domains
  - **Security and Risk Management** 
    - defining security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and legal regulations
  - **Asset Security** 
    - securing digital and physical assets; also related to storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data
  - **Security Architecture and Engineering** 
    - optimizing data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place to protect assets and data
  - **Communication and Network Security**
    - managing and securing physical networks and wireless communication
  - **Identity and Access Management** 
    - access and authorization to keep data secure by making sure users follow established policies to control and manage assets
  - **Security Assessment and Testing** 
    - conducting security control testing evaluations and security assessment reports to improve existing controls or implement new controls
  - **Security Operations** 
    - conducting investigations and implementing preventative measures
  - **Software Development Security** 
    - using secure coding practices

## Week 2 - Security Frameworks and Controls

### Frameworks and Controls
- **Frameworks** &rarr; guidelines used for building plans to help mitgate risks and threats to data and privacy, other frameworks provide guidance for how to prevent, detect, and respond to security breaches
- **Controls** &rarr; safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks
  - e.g. *encryption, authentication, authorization*

### CIA Triad
- *Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability*
- Helps inform organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies

### NIST CSF
- **NIST CSF** &rarr; NIST Cybersecurity Framework
  - voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk
- Core functions
  - **Identify** &rarr; management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization's people and assets
  - **Protect** &rarr; strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training, and tolls that help mitgate cybersecurity threats
  - **Detect** &rarr; identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections
  - **Respond** &rarr; ensuring proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents and implement improvements to the security process
  - **Recover** &rarr; returning affected systems back to normal operationo

### OWASP Principles and Audits
- **OWASP** &rarr; Open Web Application Security Project
  - *Minimize attack surface area*
  - *Principle of least privilege* &rarr; allow the least amount of access for employees to perform their job tasks
  - *Defense in depth* &rarr; multiple layers of defense
  - *Separation of duties* &rarr; no one should be given so many privileges that can be misused
  - *Keep security simple* &rarr; unnecessarily complicated security controls can make it impossible to manage
  - *Fix issues correctly* &rarr; don't do a job halfway
  - *Establish secure defaults* &rarr; default state for users should be secure
  - *Fail securely* &rarr; when a security control fails, it should default to its most secure option
  - *Don't trust services* &rarr; outside partners can have different security policies and orgs shouldn't explicitly trust their partners' systems
  - *Avoid 'security by obscurity'* &rarr; security of key systems should not rely on keeping details hidden
  
- Plan an audit
  - *Establish scope*
  - *Conduct a risk assessment*
  - *Complete a controls assessment*
  - *Assess compliance*
  - *Communicate results to stakeholders*

## Week 3 - Intro to Cybersec Tools

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) dashboards
- Log Sources
  - **Firewall Log** &rarr; record of attempted or established connections for incoming traffic from the internet; also includes outbound requests to the internet from within the network
  - **Network Log** &rarr; record of all devices and computers that enter and leave the network; also records connections between devices and services on the network
  - **Server Log** &rarr; record of events related to services such as websites, emails, or file shares; also includes actions such as login, password, and username requests
- SIEM tools index and minimize the number of logs that need to be manually reviews and analyzed, increase efficiency and save time
  - must be configured and customized to meet the needs of each org
- Types of SIEM tools
  - **Self-hosted** &rarr; orgs install, operate, and maintain the tool using their own infra, such as server capacity; ideal when an org is required to maintain physical control over confidential data
  - **Cloud-hosted** &rarr; maintained and managed by the SIEM providers, accessible through the internet; ideal for orgs that don't want to invest in creating and maintaining their own infra
  - **Hybrid** &rarr; combo of self and cloud-hosted; ideal for leverage the benefits of cloud-hosting while maintaining physical control over confidential data
- Common SIEM Tools
  - **Splunk Enterprise** &rarr; self-hosted 
  - **Splunk Cloud** &rarr; cloud-hosted
  - **Chronicle** &rarr; cloud-native
- Splunk
  - **Security Posture Dashboard**
    - designed for SOCs; displays last 24 hours of an org's notable security-related events and trends and allows security professionals to determine if infra and policies are performing as intended, used to monitor and investigate potential threats in real time (e.g. *suspicious network activity originating from a specific IP*)
  - **Executive Summary Dashboard**
    - analyzes and monitors overall health of the org over time; helps security teams improve security measures that reduce risk, might be used to provide high level insights to stakeholders (e.g. *generating a summary of security incidents and trends over a specific period of time*)
  - **Incident Review Dashboard**
    - allows analysts to identify suspicious patterns that can occur in the event of an incident; assists by highlighting higher risk items that need immediate review by an analyst, provides visual timeline of the events leading up to an incident
  - **Risk Analysis Dashboard**
    - helps identify risk for each risk object (e.g. specific user, computer, or IP); shows changes in risk-related activity or behavior, such as a user logging in outside of normal working hours or unusually high network traffic from a specific computer, might be used to analyze the potentialimpact of vulnerabilities in critical assets, which helps analysts prioritize their risk mitigation efforts

## Week 4 - Playbooks
- Incident Response Playbook phases
  - **Preparation** &rarr; prepare to mitigate the likelihood, risk, and impact of an incident by documenting procedures, establishing staffing plans, and educating users
  - **Detection and Analysis** &rarr; detect and analyze events using defined processes and technology
  - **Containment** &rarr; prevent further damage and reduce the immediate impact of a security incident; high priority for orgs, prevents ongoing risks to critical assets and data
  - **Eradication and Recovery** &rarr; involves complete removal of an incident's artifacts so that an organization can return to normal operation; remove malicious code and mitigate vulnerabilities
  - **Post-incident Activity** &rarr; document the incident, inform org leadership, apply lessons learn to ensure that an org is better prepared to handle future incidents
  - **Coordination** &rarr; report incidents and share information, throughout the incident response process, based on the org's established standards
