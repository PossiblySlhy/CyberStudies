# Assets, Threats, and Vulnerabilities

## Intro to Asset Security
### Introduction to Assets
- An asset is anything that's valuable to an org
- #### Asset Classifications
  - **Restricted**: highest level, reserved for sensitive, need-to-know assets 
  - **Confidential**: assets whose disclosure may lead to a significant negative impact on an org 
  - **Internal-only**: assets that are available to employees and business partners
  - **Public**: lowest level, assets have no negative consequences to the org if released 

### Digital and Physical Assets 
- #### Asset States
  - **In use**: data being accessed by one or more users
  - **In transit**: data travelling from one point to another, i.e. data is in transit when you hit send on an email
  - **At rest**: data not currently being accessed by any users 

### Risk and Asset Security 
- Regulations: rules set by a government or other authority to control the way something is done
- #### Security plans
  - **Policies**: a set of rules that reduce risk and protects information
    - strategic, focuses on identifying the scope, objectives, and limitations of a security plan 
  - **Standards**: concerns how well assets are being protected
    - tactical, informs how policies are set by being a point of reference 
  - **Procedures**: step-by-step instructions to perform a security task 

- #### NIST CSF 
- **N**ational **I**nstitute of **S**tandards and **T**echnology **C**yber **S**ecurity **F**ramework
  - Openly provides companies with a set of frameworks and security
  - Consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk 
  - Three main components:
    - **Core**: simplified version of the functions or duties of a security plan 
      - identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover
    - **Tiers**: provides security teams with a way to measure performance across each of the five above functions 
      - ranges from levels 1 to 4, where level 1 (passive) is a function that reaches bare minimum standards and level 4 (adaptive) is a function that is being performed at an exemplary standard 
    - **Profiles**: provides insight into the current state of a security plan 
      - i.e. snapshotting the state of systems at different times to compare 

## Protecting Organizational Assets 
### Safeguard Information 
- #### Security control types
  - **Technical**: technologies used to protect assets (*i.e. encryption, authentication, etc.*)
  - **Operational**: controls related to maintaining day-to-day security environment (*i.e. awareness training and incident response*)
  - **Managerial**: centered around how the other two reduce risk (*i.e. policies, standards, and procedures*)

- #### Principle of Least Privilege
  - security concept in which a user is only granted the minimum levels of access and authorization required to complete their job task 
  - fundamental security control that supports CIA triad
  - ##### Determining access and authorization 
    - Who is the user?
      - Guest, User/Staff, Service (granted to apps or software that need to interact with other software on the network), Privileged accounts
      - Best practice to baseline access for each account before implementing least privilege 
    - How much access do they need to a specific resource?
      - Temporary, permanent, etc.
  - ##### Auditing account privileges
    - Usage Audits: security team reviews which resources each account is accessing and what the user is doing
      - can help determine whether users are acting in accordance with an organization's security policies
      - can help identify whether a user has permissions that can be revoked due to not being used 
    - Privilege Audits: combats privilege keep, assesses whether a user's role is in alignment with the resources they have access to 
    - Account Change Audits: includes going over directory records and logs to review changes made to user accounts and look for suspicious activity

### Encryption methods
- #### **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**
  - encryption framework that secures the exchange of information online
  - keys can be generated using OpenSSL 
  - Two steps 
  - ##### Exchange of encrypted information
    - **Asymmetric encryption**: use of a public and private key pair for encryption and decryption of data, only owner can decrypt
      - Ex: 3DES, AES 
    - **Symmetric encryption**: uses one key for all access that can be shared by choice
      - Ex: RSA, DSA
  - ##### Establishment of trust by using digital certificates
    - **Digital Certificate**:: file that verifies the identity of a public key holder

- #### Non-repudiation and hashing
  - **Hashes** are one-way, unlike algorithms/keys, can't be decrypted
    - makes data integrity possible, aka **non-repudiation**
    - generate hash value for any file, most common is *sha256*
  - **Rainbow** tables
    - file of pre-generated hash values and their associated plaintext, can be used as a sort-of dictionary of weak passwords
  - **Salting**
    - random string of characters that's added to data before it's hashed, used to strengthen hash functions
    - helps defeat rainbow tables 

### Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
- #### Access Controls and Authentication systems
  - Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
  - ##### Authentication 
    - access controls that verify who the user is 
    - Factors:
      - Knowledge: something the user knows (i.e. password, security questions)
      - Ownership: something the user possesses (i.e. one-time passcode via email or text)
      - Characteristic: something the user is (i.e. biometrics)
    - information provided during authentication needs to match the information on file for these access controls to work
    - SSO can be used for authentication, typically paired with MFA 
    - see ![image]("Google Cybersecurity/images/SSOchart.png")
  - ##### Authorization 
    - separation of duties reduces risk of system failures
    - **Basic Auth**: used by HTTP, establishes a user's request to access a server
    - **OAuth**: open-standard authorization, shares designated access between applications
      - sends and receives access requests using API tokens
  - ##### Accounting (Auditing)
    - practice of monitoring the access logs of a system 

## Vulnerabilities in Systems 
### Flaws in the system 
- #### Vulnerability Management
  - Vulnerability: a weakness that *can* be exploited by a threat 
  - Four steps of Vulnerability Management
    - Identify vulnerabilities 
    - Consider potential exploits 
    - Prepare defenses against threats 
    - Evaluate defenses 
- #### Defense in Depth 
  - layered approach to vulnerability management that reduces risk 
    - **Perimeter Layer** i.e. usernames and passwords, mainly a user authentication layer that filters external access 
    - **Network Layer** i.e. firewalls, mainly authorization 
    - **Endpoint Layer** i.e. devices that have access on a network, protected by anti-virus
    - **Application Layer** i.e. interfaces that are used to interact with technology, protection is built into the application such as MFA 
    - **Data Layer** i.e. PII, protected by asset classifications 
- #### CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)
  - originally made by MITRE, sponsored by US Gov
  - CNA, CVE Numbering Authority
    - must be independent of other issues
    - must be recognized as a potential security risk
    - submitted with supporting evidence
    - only affects one codebase
  - NIST National Vulnerabilities Database
    - CVSS, common vulnerability scoring system measures the severity of a vulnerability between 0-10
### Identify System Vulnerabilities 
- #### Vulnerability Assessments
  - Four Step Process
    - Identification: use of scanning tools and manual testing to find vulnerabilities
    - Vulnerability Analysis: each vulnerability is tested, try to find the source of the problem
    - Risk Assessment: score is assigned to each vulnerability
      - score is based on severity and likelihood
    - Remediation: address vulnerabilities and fix them as well as possible
- #### Approaches to Vulnerability Scanning
  - Vulnerability Scanner
    - Analyzes each attack surface
      - Perimeter layer (i.e authentication systems)
      - Network layer (i.e. firewalls)
      - Endpoint layer (i.e. devices on the network)
      - Application layer (i.e. software)
      - Data layer (i.e. information being stored, in transit, or in use)
