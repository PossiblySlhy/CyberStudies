# Databases and SQL

## Intro to SQL and Databases

### Introduction to databases 
- **Relational Database** 
  - *structured database containing tables that are related to each other*
  - can connect 2 tables when they have a common key
  #### Keys
    - **Primary Key**
      - a column where every row has a unique entry, no repeated or null values, can only have one
    - **Foreign Key**
      - a column that is a primary key in another table, can have non-unique or null values, can have many

### SQL Queries
- #### Basic Queries
  - **SELECT**
    - which column to return
  - **FROM**
    - which table to get it from
  - **ORDER BY**
    - sorts numerically/alphabetically by the selected column
      - use DESC to sort in reverse order 
      - can take multiple params
- *Example: returns values from customerid, city, country columns in the customers table in reverse alphabetical/numerical order*
``` sql
  SELECT customerid, city, country   
  FROM customers    
  ORDER BY country, city DESC;
```

- #### Basic Filters
  - **WHERE**
    - used in combination with SELECT to narrow down results to a certain keyword
  - **LIKE** 
    - used in combination with WHERE to select for a pattern
      - uses % or _ as a wildcard; % for any number of characters, _ for one character 
- #### Filter dates and numbers
  - **BETWEEN**
    - returns values in a specified range (inclusive)
    - use AND to separate the two values
- #### AND, OR, and NOT
  - **AND**
    - both specified specified conditions must be true
  - **OR** 
    - one or the other specified condition must be true
  - **WHERE NOT / AND NOT / OR NOT**
    - negates a condition, i.e. everything but the specified condition 

### SQL Joins
- Useful when you need information from two different tables 
- Two main types of JOINs, **OUTER JOIN** and **INNER JOIN**
  - INNER JOINs require a matching key (primary key and foreign key) in both tables, OUTER JOINs do not necessarily require a like key
- Syntax: table.column 
- #### INNER JOIN 
  - Think of a venn diagram that only returns the middle, overlapping section
  - Returns rows matching on a specified column that exists in more than one table 
  - Syntax: INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.wantedColumn =  table2.wantedColumn;
  - *Example: returns selected values from employees and machines table based on the common employee_id key*
  ``` sql
  SELECT username, office, operating_system   
  FROM employees   
  INNER JOIN machines ON employees.employee_id = machines.employee_id;
  ```   
- #### LEFT JOIN 
  - Venn diagram that only returns the left circle, including the overlapping values 
  - Creates a "new table"
  - New table contains: rows with specified matching values, all other rows from the left table, all columns of both tables 
    - if the second table has keys that the first table does not, it will fill in those columns with NULL
- #### RIGHT JOIN 
  - Venn diagram that only returns the right circle, including the overlapping values 
  - Inverse of LEFT JOIN 
  - New table contains: rows with specified matching values, all other rows from the right table, all columns of both tables 
    - if the first table has keys that the second table does not, it will fill in those columns with NULL 
- #### FULL OUTER JOIN 
  - Venn diagram that includes everything 
  - Returns all columns, rows from both tables 
    - if a row doesn't have a value for a particular column, it will fill in with NULL
