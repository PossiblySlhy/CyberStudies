## Week 1 - World of Cybersecurity 

### Key terms
- **Compliance** &rarr; process of adhering to internal standards and external regulations and enables organizations to avoid fines, audits, and security breaches
- **Security Frameworks** &rarr; guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy
- **Security Controls** &rarr; safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks; used with security frameworks to establish a strong security posture
- **Security Posture** &rarr; organization's ability to manage its defense of critical assets and data and react to change; a strong posture leads to lower risk for the organization
- **Threat Actor** / **Malicious Attacker** &rarr; any person or group who presents a security risk; this risk can relate to computers, applications, networks, and data
- **Internal Threat** &rarr; can be a current or former employee, external vendor, or trusted partner who poses a security risk; can be accidental or intentional
- **Network Security** &rarr; practice of keeping an organization's network infrastructure secure from unauthorized access; includes data, services, systems, and devices stored in the organization's network
- **Cloud Security** &rarr; process of ensuring that assets stored in the cloud are properly configured and access to those assets is limited to authorized users

### Acronyms
- **CIA** Triad &rarr; Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability
- **SIEM** &rarr; Security Information and Event Management

## Week 2 - Evolution of Cybersecurity

### CISSP Domains
- **Security and Risk Management**
  - Defines security goals and objectives, risk mitigation, compliance, business continuity, and the law
- **Asset Security**
  - Secures digital and physical assets; also related to the storage, maintenance, retention, and destruction of data
- **Security Architecture and Engineering**
  - Optimizes data security by ensuring effective tools, systems, and processes are in place
- **Communications and Network Security**
  - Manage and secure physical networks and wireless communications
- **Identity and Access Management**
  - Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets such as networks and applications
- **Security Assessment and Training**
  - Conducting security control testing, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting security audits to monitor for risks, threats, and vulnerabilities
- **Security Operations**
  - Conducting investgations and implementing preventative measures
- **Software Development Security**
  - Uses secure coding practices, which are a set of recommended guidelines that are used to create secure applications and services

## Week 3 - Protect Against Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

### Frameworks and Controls
- **Security controls** are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks 
- **CIA Triad** &rarr; Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability 
    - Confidentiality - only authorized users are able to access data 
    - Integrity - all data is unchanged and safe 
    - Availability - data is available to authorized users whenever they need it 
- **Security frameworks** &rarr; guidelines used for building plans for risk mitigation and threats to data privacy 
    - Identify and document security goals 
    - Set guidelines to achieve security goals 
    - Implement strong security processes 
    - Monitoring and communicating results
- Specific controls, frameworks, and compliance 
    - **NIST CSF/RMF** &rarr; National Institute of Standards and Technology Cyber Security Framework / Risk Management Framework 
    - **FERC-NARC** &rarr; Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Reliability Corporation
        - regulation that applies to organizations that work with electricity or power grid
        - places an obligation to prepare for, mitigate, and report any potential security incident that can negatively impact the power grid 
        - also legally required to adhere to **CIP** &rarr; Critical Infrastructure Protection
    - **FedRAMP** &rarr; Federal Risk and Authorizaiton Management Program 
        - US fed program that standardizes security assessment, authorization, monitoring, and handling of cloud services and product offerings
    - **CIS** &rarr; Center for Internet Security 
        - nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis; provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks 
    - **GDPR** &rarr; General Data Protection Regulation 
        - EU data regulations that protects the processing of EU citizen data and right to privacy, in and out of the EU
    - **HIPAA** &rarr; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Actor
        - US fed law established in 1996 to protect patient health information 
        - privacy, security, breach notification
    - **ISO** &rarr; International Organization for Standardization
        - internal standards related to technology manufacturing and management across borders
    - **SOC** &rarr; System and Organizations Controls (type 1 and 2)
        - **AICPA** &rarr; American Institute of Certified Public Accountants 
        - series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies
  
### Ethics in Cybersecurity
- Ethical Principles
  - **Confidentiality** &rarr; not sharing PII and keeping PII safe
  - **Privacy protection** &rarr; safeguard information from unauthorized use
  - **Laws** &rarr; remain unbiased and work with the highest respoect for the law
  - In terms of counterattacks
    - Can only be approved by the **International Court of Justice** with the following guidelines
      - The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first
      - The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop
      - The counterattack does not escalate the situation
      - The counterattack effects can be reversed

## Week 4 - Cybersecurity and Programming Languages

### Impoortant Cybersecurity Tools
- Common Cybersecurity Tools
  - **SIEM** &rarr; Security Information and Event Management
