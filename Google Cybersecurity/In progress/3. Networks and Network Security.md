## Week 1 - Intro to Networks
### Network Tools
- Physical Tools: Hubs, Switches, Routers, Modems
  - *Hubs* broadcast data to all connected devices
  - *Switches* broadcast data to a specified device
  - *Routers* connect networks together
    - Data goes from the host to the router &rarr; Router reads the destination address &rarr; Router forwards the data to the intended network's router &rarr; Receiving router directs the information to the intended host
  - *Modems* connect routers to the internet
    - Data goes from host to the router &rarr; Router sends data through the modem to the internet &rarr; Intended recipient's modem receives data &rarr; Modem transfers data to the router &rarr; Recipient router forwards information to the intended host
- Many of the functions performed by physical devices can be done by virtualization tools provided by Cloud service providers (`CSP`)
- Firewalls usually sit between the internal network and the internet (e.g. between the modem and the router)

### Cloud Networks
- **`SaaS`**, **`IaaS`**, and **`PaaS`**
  - *`Software as a Service`* &rarr; software suites operated by the CSP that a company can use without hosting the software
  - *`Infrastructure as a Service`* &rarr; virtual containers and storage configured remotely through the CSP's API or web console, can be used to operate existing applications and other tech workloads
  - *`Platform as a Service`* &rarr; tools that application developers use to design applications for their company, designed and accessed in the cloud and used for an org's specific needs
- **`SDNs`**
  - *`Software Defined Networks`* are made up of virtual network devices and services
    - SDNs provide virtual switches, routers, firewalls, and more
    - Most network hardware also supports virtualization and SDNing
      - physical switches and routers use software hosted on servers provided by the CSP

### Network Communication
#### Intro to Network Communication
- *`Data Packets`* contain information about where the packet is going, where it's coming from, and the contents of the message (like a letter)
  - Contains 
    - *`Header`* &rarr; includes IP address and MAC of the destination device and a protocol number that tells the receiving device what to do with the information contained in the packet
    - *`Body`* &rarr; includes the message that needs to be transmitted to the receiving device
    - *`Footer`* &rarr; includes a signal that indicates the packet is finished
- Network performance can be measured by *bandwidth* (calculated by quantity of data per second)
- *Speed* refers to the rate at which data packets are received or downloaded
  - * Irregularities in either of the above could be an indicator of an attack *

#### TCP/IP Model
- **`TCP`** = *`Transmission Control Protocol`* &rarr; internet communication protocol that allows two devices to connect and stream data, includes a set of instructions to organize data so it can be sent across a network
- **`IP`** = *`Internet Protocol`* &rarr; set of standards used for routing and addressing data packets as they travel between devices, includes IP addressing
- *`Port`* &rarr; software-based location that organizes the sending and receiving of data between devices, divides network traffic into segments based on the service they will perform
- The Four Layers of TCP/IP
  - *`Network Access`* &rarr; creation of data packets and their transmission across a network, includes hardware devices connected to physical cables and switches that direct data to its destination
  - *`Internet`* &rarr; IP addresses are attached to data packets to indicate the location of the sender and receiver, also focuses on how networks connect to each other
  - *`Transport`* &rarr; permits or denies communication with other devices and includes information about the status of the connection, includes protocols to control the flow of traffic across a network (error control)
  - *`Application`* &rarr; determines how the data packets will interact with receiving devices, includes file transfers and email services

## Week 4 - Security Hardening

### OS Hardening
#### OS Hardening Practices
- Regular Interval Practices (Updates, backups, up-to-date lists of devices and users)
  - **`Patch Updates`**
    - update that addresses security vulnerabilities within a program or product
    - latest patch should be added to the *`baseline image`*
      - baseline images is a configuration of a documented set of specifications within a system that is used as a basis for future builds, releases, and updates.
      - Ex: may contain a firewall rule with a list of allowed and disallowed network ports
  - **`Hardware/Software Disposal`**
    - ensures old hardware is properly wiped and disposed of
    - deleting unused software to avoid unknown vulnerabilities
  - **`Strong Password Policy`**
- `One-time Practices` (Configuring devices to fit a secure encryption standard)

### Network Hardening
#### Network Hardening Practices
- Regular Interval Practices (Firewall rule maintenance, network log analysis, patch updates, and server backups)
- One-time Practices
  - **`Port Filtering`**
    - can be formed over the network
    - firewall function that blocks or allows certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication
      - only needed ports are allowed
  - **`Network Segmentation`**
    - creates isolated subnets
      - can be used to limit access to other positions or wall off restricted comms/info
  - **`Network Encryption`**
    - all network comms should be encrypted using the latest encryption standards
      - restricted zones should have higher standards than the rest of the network
