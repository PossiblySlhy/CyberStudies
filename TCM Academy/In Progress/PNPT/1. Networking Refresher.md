# IP Addresses - Layer 3 (Routing)

- ## `ifconfig`
  - ### inet/inet6 &rarr; IP addresses
    > `inet = IPv4`
    >
	> `inet6 = IPv6`

  -  IPv4 has 4,294,967,296 available addresses
  - IPv6 has an inconceivable amount of addresses

- ## `NAT` &rarr; **N**etwork **A**ddress **T**ranslation
	- ### Assign private IP Address spaces
	    > `192.168.x.x &rarr; Private Address range`
	- ### Private Address Classes
		> `Class A` &rarr; Large Business - (10.0 range)
		> 
        > `Class B`
		> 
        > `Class C` &rarr; Private / Small Business (192.168 range)

# MAC Addresses - Layer 2 (Switching)

#### `Media Access Control`

> Take first 3 octets to a MAC Address Lookup to help identify what the device is

# TCP, UDP, and Three-Way Handshake - Layer 4 (Transport)

- ## `TCP`
    > &rarr; `Transmission Control Protocol` - Connection oriented protocol
    > - Most commonly scanned protocol
    > - `Send SYN &rarr; Receive SYN ACK &rarr; Reply ACK`

- ## `UDP`
    > &rarr; `User Datagram Protocol` - Connectionless protocol

- ## `Wireshark`l
    > - Scan for TCP SYN, SYNACK, ACK packages on eth/wlan interfaces

## 255.255.255.0
- **`/24 network`** &rarr; used in households/small businesses
  > - 2^8 hosts = 256 hosts - 2 = 254
  > - As you turn off bits, number of hosts doubles
  > - Always subtract 2 from hosts
  >     - `Network ID (first IP) uses x.x.x.0 and Broadcast ID (last IP) uses x.x.x.255`
  > - Each 255, locks down the bit of an IP Address
  >     - Ex: IP Address 10.1.0.0/16 &rarr; `255.255.0.0 subnet = 10.1 will always be the same on that network`
