# Passive Reconnaissance Overview

## Physical / Social
> **Location Information**
>  - Satellite images
>  - Drone recon
>  - Building layout

> **Job Information**
>  - Employees
>  - Pictures (photos of badge, desk, computer etc.)

## Web / Host
> **Target Validation**
> - `WHOIS`, `nslookup`, `dnsrecon`

> **Finding Subdomains**
> - Google Fu, `dig`, `Nmap`, `Sublist3r`, `Bluto`, `crt.sh`, etc.

> **Fingerprinting**
> - `Nmap`, Wappalyzer, WhatWeb, BuiltWith, `Netcat`

> **Data Breaches**
> - HaveIBeenPwned, Breach-Parse, WeLeakInfo

# Discovering an Email Address

## hunter.io
> 50 to 100 free searches per month
> Search by domain name
> Sign up with gmail or other email
    
## phonebook.cz
> Search by domain name
    
## clearbit
> Chrome extension
    
## emailhippo
> Used to verify email addresses
    
#### Use these tools to find company structure, identify important people, email format for spoofing, etc.

# Gathering Breached Credentials with Breach-Parse

## Getting Breach-Parse
> `https://github.com/hmaverickadams/breach-parse`
> - 40+GB download

## Using Breach-Parse
> Contains emails and passwords that have been dumped from known breaches
> - `./breach-parse.sh @[domain] [output file].txt`
> - look for repeat results and attempt the password listed in the file (password stuffing) #vocabulary

# Hunting Breached Credentials with DeHashed

## dehashed.com
> - Requires subscription (only takes crypto)
> - Can use found credentials to find repeats on other sites
> - Reveals hashed passwords and usernames
>   - take the found hashed passwords and search for those to reveal other accounts tied to that same hash 
> - Map connections to pin down users

## hashes.org
>  Used to crack hashes
> - Can also google hashes if they don't work on this site

# Hunting Subdomains

## `sublist3r`
> `-d [domain]`

## `crt.sh`
> search for `%.<domain>.com`

## Better tools than sublist3r
> `OWASP Amass` 
> - download from Github
> - can be slow to run
> 
> `tomnomnom httprobe`

## Subdomain results
> Look for mail servers, apps, etc.
> - Some might be dead, check httprobe

# Identifying Website Techonologies

## `builtwith.com`
> plug in target website
>
> shows what the site is built on

## `wappalyzer`
> extension
> 
> more of an active kind of reconnaissance
> 
> check for known vulnerabilities in the tech used to build the site

## `whatweb`
> `whatweb <url>`
> - #cli-command
> - might get more information than wappalyzer gives

# Google Fu

## Google Search Operators
> - `site:<site>`
> - `-<text>` to remove results containing specified text
> - can help find unkown subdomains
> - `filetype:<.file>`
