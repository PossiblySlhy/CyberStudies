# Buffer Overflows Explained

## Anatomy of Memory
> Kernel  
> Stack  
> | &nbsp;&nbsp; ESP (Extended Stack Pointer)  
> | &nbsp;&nbsp; Buffer Space  
> | &nbsp;&nbsp; EBP (Extended Base Pointer)  
> | &nbsp;&nbsp; EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer / Return Address)  
> Heap

> &rarr; A buffer overflow overloads the buffer space and pushes down to the EIP, allowing you to control the pointer and get a reverse shell

## Steps to Conduct Buffer Overflows
> 1. Spiking
>       - Method to find a vulnerable part of the program
> 2. Fuzzing
>       - Sending a lot of characters to try to break the program
> 3. Finding the Offset
>       - Identifies the point where the program broke
> 4. Overwriting the EIP
>       - Use the offset to overwrite the EIP
> 5. Finding Bad Characters
> 6. Finding the Right Module
> 7. Generating Shellcode
