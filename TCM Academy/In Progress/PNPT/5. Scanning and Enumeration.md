# Scanning with Nmap

## Get IP on Kioptrix box

> ping random IP, check FROM line

## `Nmap`
> Scans for open ports and services
> - Does a SYN &rarr; SYNACK &rarr; RST (reset)
> 
> `nmap -T4 -p- -A <target IP>`
>   - `-T4` &rarr; signifies speed of scan
>   - `-p-` &rarr; scans all ports
>   - `-p` or no p &rarr; scans top 1000 ports
>   - `-p X, Y, Z` &rarr; scans specified ports
>   - `-A` &rarr; displays all information the scan finds
> 
> Decent tool to write scripts for

# Enumerating HTTP and HTTPS

## Point of attack
> ports 80, 443, 139
> - commonly found with exploits
> port 22
> - tends to be pretty safe

## Investigating `80/443`
> Go to the website (IP address)
> - Default web page indicates a good finding
>   - Default pages can provide information about back end structure
> - Error page (404) can sometimes indicate version numbers and host names
>   - `Information Disclosure`
> 
> Keep good notes
> - Note open ports, IPs, version numbers, and checkpoints (i.e. finding the default web page)

## `nikto`
> Web vulnerability scanner
> - Good beginner tool
> - Good security might block nikto, but not always
> 
> `nikto -h <http(s)://IP>`
> - Provides a list of potential vulnerabilities and out of date services
> - Gives some potential vectors of attack
> - Does some dirbusting

## `dirbuster`, `dirb`, `gobuster`
> dirbuster is a GUI program
> - paste target URL including the port number
> - download wordlists from Kali

## `burp-suite`
> Repeater
> - Use repeater to change the request to try and get different responses
> 
> Target > Scope
> - Use Scope tool to limit the focus to a certain domain or address

# Enumerating SMB

## Investigating `139`
>  Find version numbers &rarr; Research potential exploits

## Metasploit #tool
> `msfconsole`
> - `search <exploit>`
>   - pulls up a list of relevant exploits
> - `use <number or exploit>`
> - `options`
>   - lists options plus required variables to run the exploit
> - `set <variable name> <target>`
>   - defines the variable
> - `run`
>   - runs the exploit using the given data

## smbclient #tool
> `smbclient -L \\\\<IP Address>\\`
> - should list out a fileshare
>   - `smbclient -L \\\\<IP Address>\\<sharename>` to access a share

# Enumerating SSH

## Investigating 22
> Attempt a connection
> -  Most of 22 is exploitation, not enumeration

<br /><br />

# Researching Potential Vulnerabilities

## Google
> Just search `<Version number of service> vulnerabilities`

## Exploit-DB #resource
> Gives code snippets to execute
> - Should be safe to use

## Rapid7 #resource
> Similar to exploit-db, made by Metasploit

## searchsploit #tool
> `searchsploit <version number>`
> - The less specific the better
> - Useful when internet connection isn't available
> - Might provide more obscure exploits
